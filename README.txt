# Task Management App (React Implementation)

## Introduction

This is a simple Task Management App built using React. It provides a user interface to manage tasks, including viewing a list of tasks, creating new tasks, updating task status, and deleting tasks.

## Features

- View a list of tasks with their title, description, and status, createdAt, updatedAt.
- Create a new task with a title and description.
- Update the status of a task (Pending, In Progress, Completed).
- Delete a task from the list.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up the project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
git clone <repo_url>


2. Navigate to the project directory:
> cd task-management-react-app


3. Install project dependencies:
> npm install


### Usage

To run the development server and view the Task Management App, use the following command:

> npm start:

The app will be accessible at `your localhost' in your web browser.

### API Integration

The React app is designed to work with a backend API for data management. Make sure you have the API server running and configure the API endpoint in the `TaskList.js` component file.

### Folder Structure

The project structure is organized as follows:

public/
src/
components/
TaskList.js
App.js
index.js
index.css
app.css
package.json
...


- `public`: Contains the HTML template and static assets.
- `src`: Contains the React components and application logic.
  - `components`: Contains the `TaskList.js` component for displaying the task list.
  - `App.js`: Main application component rendering the `TaskList` component.
  - `index.js`: Entry point of the React app.
  - `index.css` and `app.css`: CSS files for styling the app.

### Deployment

> npm run build
